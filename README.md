Grapher scripts

Make all graphs in active graph/page uniform and pretty.

Usage pattern: 
1. Set on page graphs (with horizontal axes that must be the same) one below another.
2. Set up (first by the number) graph horizontal axis (first by the number) values representation and limits.
3. Set up first plot limits.
4. Run "GrapherUnifierOneDocument.bas" from the Scripter or Grapher defaul interface.

Script actions:
Set all graphs fonts with values from script.
Set all graphs horizontal position with values from script.
Set main axes linked.
Set main axes color, ticks with values from script.
Set horizontal labels representation the same with first (by the number) graph and first (by the number) horizontal axis.
...
Many, many actions

p.s. I have to check shoud I change some value or not otherwise it works much slower.
